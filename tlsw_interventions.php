                TLSW can be suitable for children who have experienced trauma and are living away from their birth
                family or with wider family under an order. When feelings are organised and externalised in narrative
                form, new meanings and understandings of self and others can be gained resulting in emotional
                regulation, resolution and recovery from trauma.<br><br>
                This intervention is helpful for children, young people and young adults who have questions, muddles
                or show unrest in relation to their past. We feel TLSW intervention can be undertaken from aged seven upwards.
                For some, depending on cureent sitution, age and level of understanding, a bespoke intervention and
                possibly a therapeutic story may suggested. <br><br>
                Work is undertaken or supervised by Independent Therapeutic Life Story Work Practitioner Suzanne
                McGladdery.
