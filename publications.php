                        “Both have put their heart and soul into each page and agonised over each character … this will be a
                        valuable addition to the practitioner’s toolbox … With genuine honesty, refreshing clarity and a
                        clear intention for the reader to learn and to develop their practice, the handbook does exactly
                        what it sets out to, as a guide and a support for those on their Therapeutic Life Story Work
                        journey.”

                        Suzanne and Karla write: ‘Life Story Work is something we do all the time, be it reminiscing with
                        friends or family about a particular event or period of our lives, or keeping memorabilia,
                        photographs and written records. Reflecting on and re-examining past events and experiences helps us
                        to make meaning of them in the present.’

                    <p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;">
                        As a qualified social worker and a certified play therapist, Suzanne and Karla have come together as
                        independent Therapeutic Life Story Work practitioners to explore their experiences and the
                        challenges they have faced to guide other practitioners entering this important area of practice.
                        They share journeys they have taken alongside the many families they have supported.
