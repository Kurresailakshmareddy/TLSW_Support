                    Therapeutic Story Books involve the worker co-creating an individually-tailored narrative with the
                    child and/ or parent, telling the story of their lives through a favourite character or area of
                    interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a model we have developed and is endorsed by Richard Rose, founder of TLSW.<br>

                <p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;">
                    Based on narrative theory, the aim is to provide a safer third-person narrative for the child which
                    fits with themes that are relevant to and resonate with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of a story to transform and
                    heal is well documented; 'helping storiesâ€¦can be used to therapeutically to provide insight, suggest
                    solutions, facilitate healing, process trauma and understand life story experience' Golding
                    (2014).

                <strong style="font-size:17px;">Therapeutic Stories can provide the child with:</strong><br><br>
                <ol style="margin-left:25px;font-size:17px;">
                    <li>A way of talking about inner experience and learning from the experience of others.</li><br>
                    <li>An experience of feeling understood and not alone in how they feel.</li><br>
                    <li>A new and helpful way of thinking about and understanding relationships, themselves and events
                        in their lives.</li>
                </ol>
                </p><br>

                <p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;">
                    A therapeutic story may be suitable for a child at an early developmental stage who may not be
                    cognitively ready for intensive Therapeutic Life Story Work but is who is showing unrest about their
                    past.&nbsp;This would not preclude Therapeutic Life Story Work at a later stage, the narrative from the
                    therapeutic story could inform and be incorporated into this work if it has been helpful for the
                    child.

                        <strong>Parents have said:</strong> &nbsp;'It helped us to approach the story in a relaxed way which was what our child needed. She is able to dip in and out of it and can re-read and ask different questions each time.'
