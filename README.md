## Therapeutic Life Work Support 

* As a part of my university project, I actively participated in a dynamic team of five individuals, undertaking a substantial project. Our objective was to create a user-friendly and responsive website for a     therapist to support the young children.

* Client Consultation: We conducted thorough consultations with the client to understand their requirements and define the website's objectives.
  
* Industry Research: Delving into the client's industry, we gained insights into the target audience and competitive landscape.
  
* Wireframe Development: We meticulously developed wireframes to plan the website's structure and layout.
  
* User Interface Design: Designing the website's user interface to ensure an engaging and intuitive experience for visitors.

* Development: Leveraging HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, and other relevant technologies, we brought the website to life.

* Testing: Testing was conducted to ensure the website's responsiveness, accessibility, and cross-browser compatibility.

* Launch and Maintenance: We successfully launched the website and provided ongoing support and maintenance.
